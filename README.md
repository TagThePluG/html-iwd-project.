Interactive Web Development Assignment
Question 1: Website Creation
Website Type

I created a Personal Portfolio Website.

Website Content

The website contains the following sections:

Home (introduction)

About Me

Skills

Education

Projects

Gallery

Contact Information

Footer with copyright information

The website was developed using only HTML, without external CSS or JavaScript.
It demonstrates a clear understanding of HTML structure, semantic elements, and attributes.

Question 2: HTML Elements
1. Five Challenging HTML Elements

<form> – Required careful structuring of inputs, labels, and submission controls.

<table> – Managing rows, headers, and data in an organized manner.

<figure> – Correct usage alongside <figcaption>.

<details> – Understanding and implementing collapsible content behavior.

<iframe> – Properly embedding external content.

2. Use of Semantic Elements

<header>: Contains the website title and navigation menu

<nav>: Holds internal navigation links

<section>: Separates major content areas such as About, Skills, and Projects

<article>: Used to represent individual projects

<footer>: Displays copyright and contact information

The use of semantic elements improves readability, accessibility, and SEO.

3. Most Useful Element

The <section> element was the most useful because it clearly groups related content, making the page structure easier to understand and maintain.

Question 3: HTML Attributes
1. Three Essential Attributes

href – Enables navigation between pages and sections

src – Loads images and embedded content

alt – Provides alternative text for images to improve accessibility

2. Difference Between class and id

id: A unique identifier used for a single element

class: A reusable identifier applied to multiple elements

3. Attribute That Improved User Experience the Most

The alt attribute improved user experience by supporting screen readers and displaying descriptive text when images fail to load.

Question 4: Development Process
1. Planning

Sketched the website layout on paper

Listed all required sections

Identified appropriate HTML elements and attributes

2. Testing and Debugging

3. Challenges and Solutions

Question 5: Git and GitHub Implementation
1. Git Commands Used

2. Commits and Strategy

A total of five (5) commits were made, each with clear and descriptive messages such as "Added projects section".

3. Importance of Version Control

Version control allows developers to track changes, collaborate effectively, maintain backups, and revert to previous versions when errors occur.
